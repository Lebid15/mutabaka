FINAL SOLUTION: Push Notifications Setup Summary
=================================================

## Current Status:
‚úÖ Push token obtained: ExponentPushToken[3Mbdk6NAXHzhbC9MN-6bHj]
‚úÖ Token saved in database
‚úÖ Device activated
‚úÖ Firebase Admin SDK installed
‚ùå Cannot send notifications - FCM Server Key required

## The Problem:
Expo Push Notifications require FCM Server Key when using `expo run:android` (development builds).
This key comes from Firebase Cloud Messaging API (Legacy), which is currently DISABLED.

## Solutions (Choose ONE):

### Solution 1: Enable Legacy API (Simplest) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
2. Click the 3 dots next to "Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)"
3. Click "Enable"
4. Copy the "Server key" that appears
5. Add to backend/.env:
   ```
   EXPO_FCM_SERVER_KEY=YOUR_SERVER_KEY_HERE
   ```
6. Restart Django server
7. Test: `python send_test_notification.py`

### Solution 2: Use EAS Build (Production-Ready)
```bash
cd f:\mtk\mobile
npm install -g eas-cli
eas build:configure
eas build --platform android --profile development
```
This creates a proper build that doesn't need Legacy API.

### Solution 3: Use Expo Go (Quick Testing Only)
- Works without FCM key
- But limited features (no custom native code)
- Not suitable for production

## Recommendation:
**Enable Legacy API** - It's the fastest solution and works perfectly for development.

The key will look like: `AAAAxxx...long-string...xxx`

Once you add it to .env and restart Django, notifications will work immediately! üéâ
